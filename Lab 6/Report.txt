Part 1:

Question 1: Drop all constraints
The following commands drops all primary and foreign keys on the database.
USE [Company]
GO

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employee] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK__Employee__CA1E8E3DA75D87B7] WITH ( ONLINE = OFF )
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employee] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Employee__DNO__276EDEB3]
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employee] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Employee__SuperS__267ABA7A]

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Department] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK__Departme__40A4CC7A619EB6FF] WITH ( ONLINE = OFF )
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Department] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Departmen__MgrSS__286302EC]
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Department] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Departmen__MgrSS__48CFD27E]
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Department] DROP CONSTRAINT [UQ__Departme__83BFD84946F629DC]


ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Dependent] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK__Dependen__7E4E1C2DFC49894D] WITH ( ONLINE = OFF )
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Dependent] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Dependent__paren__2E1BDC42]


ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Dept_Location] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK__Dept_Loc__ED088203B78A5F43] WITH ( ONLINE = OFF )
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Dept_Location] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Dept_Locati__DNO__2B3F6F97]


ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Project] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK__Project__BBE761DD0227A3CA] WITH ( ONLINE = OFF )
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Project] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__Project__Dnum__31EC6D26]
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Project] DROP CONSTRAINT [UQ__Project__173BB01CFEFD66BB]

The following commands show the current state of the department and employee tables.
use company
select * from Department;
select * from Employee;

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[WORKS_ON] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK__WORKS_ON__B65F9BE817B4F933] WITH ( ONLINE = OFF )
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[WORKS_ON] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__WORKS_ON__Essn__34C8D9D1]
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[WORKS_ON] DROP CONSTRAINT [FK__WORKS_ON__Pno__35BCFE0A]
GO


alter table Works_On
Drop Constraint FK__WORKS_ON__Pno__6E01572D, FK__WORKS_ON__Pno__6EF57B66, FK__WORKS_ON__Pno__6FE99F9F;
alter table Project
DROP CONSTRAINT PK__Project__BBE761DD0227A3CA;

Question 2:

The following command creates the update trigger and shows its use.

use company
go
Create Trigger EMPDEPTFK_UPDATE
	ON Department
	FOR UPDATE
AS
	IF UPDATE(Dnumber)
Begin
	Update Employee
		set DNO=inserted.Dnumber
			from Employee, deleted, inserted
			where Employee.DNO = deleted.Dnumber
			END
GO
Update Department SET DNUMBER = 99 WHERE Dnumber = 4;

The following commands add the delete trigger and shows its use. All instances where Dnumber was set to 5 were deleted and reset to the default value of 1.

Create Trigger EMPDEPTFK_DELETE
	on department
	for delete
as
	declare @default int
	set @default = 1
begin
		Update Employee
				set DNO=@default
				From employee, deleted
				where employee.DNO=deleted.Dnumber
				END
go
Delete from department where Dnumber=5;

The following commands drop both triggers.
use company
drop trigger EMPDEPTFK_UPDATE;
drop trigger EMPDEPTFK_DELETE;

Question 3: Create the stored Procedure SP_Audit_Dept that will insert all data changes for the department table.

The following creates a table to store the changes to the department table in

--Table used to record all changes to the department table
Create Table Audit_Dept_Table(
	date_of_change DATE NOT NULL,
	old_Dname varchar(15) NOT NULL,
	new_Dname varchar(15),
	old_Dnumber INT NOT NULL,
	new_Dnumber INT,
	old_MgrSSN char(9) NOT NULL,
	new_MgrSSN char(9)
);

The following commands create the audit procedure.
Create Procedure SP_Audit_Dept(
	@old_Dname VARCHAR (15),
	@new_Dname VARCHAR (15),
	@old_Dnumber int,
	@new_Dnumber int, 
	@old_MgrSSN CHAR(9),
	@new_MgrSSN CHAR(9))
	AS
		declare @date_of_change DATE = GETDATE()
	BEGIN
		insert into Audit_dept_table Values(
			@date_of_change, @old_Dname, @new_Dname, @old_Dnumber, @new_Dnumber, 
			@old_MgrSSN, @new_MgrSSN);
	END

The following commands creates the update trigger for the department table.
Create trigger EMPDEPTFK_UPDATE
	on Department
	for UPDATE
AS
	declare @old_Dname VARCHAR(15)
	declare @old_Dnumber INT
	declare @old_MgrSSN INT
	declare @new_Dname VARCHAR(15)
	declare @new_Dnumber INT
	declare @new_MgrSSN INT
BEGIN
	if UPDATE(Dnumber)
	UPDATE Employee
		set DNO = inserted.Dnumber
			From Employee, deleted, inserted
			where employee.DNO = deleted.Dnumber
	select @old_Dname = deleted.Dname,
		   @old_dnumber = deleted.Dnumber,
		   @old_MgrSSN=deleted.MgrSSN
		
	From deleted;
	select @new_Dname = inserted.Dname,
			@new_Dnumber = inserted.Dnumber,
			@new_MgrSSN = inserted.MgrSSN
	From inserted;

	EXEC SP_Audit_Dept @old_Dname, @new_Dname, @old_Dnumber, @new_Dnumber, @old_MgrSSN,@new_MgrSSN;
	END

Thefollowing commands create the delete trigger.

Create trigger EMPDEPTFK_DELETE
	on department
	for delete
AS
	declare @default int
	declare @old_Dname varchar(15)
	declare @old_Dnumber INT
	declare @old_MgrSSN INT
	set @default =1
BEGIN
	Update employee
		set DNO=@default
			from employee, deleted
			where employee.DNO=deleted.Dnumber;
	select @old_Dname=deleted.Dname,
		   @old_Dnumber=deleted.Dnumber,
		   @old_MgrSSN=deleted.MgrSSN
	from deleted;

	exec SP_audit_Dept @old_Dname, NULL, @old_Dnumber, NULL, @old_MgrSSN, NULL;
END


The following commands show the employee and department tables prior to performing updates.
use company
select * from Department;
select * from Employee;

The following command shows the excution of the update procedure.
Update department set dname = 'Robotics' where dnumber = 99;


The following command shows the updated department table and then the audit table logging the change. Dname is only an attribute of the department table so the employee table was not changed. 
The administration table was correctly updated to robotics and the changed was correctly logged.
use company 
select * from Department;
select * from Audit_Dept_Table;

The following command tests the delete procedure and trigger.
delete from department where Dnumber = 99;

The following command shows the resultant tables after executing the trigger. The delete trigger fired 
which is recorded in the Audit table. The deletion of the department set all employees orginally in the Administration (robotics)
department to the default department, headquarters.
